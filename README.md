# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions in Rust

Welcome to my repository of solutions for the Advent of Code (AoC) 2023, written in Rust! This is primarily a learning project aimed at the beginning of my Rust programming skills and problem-solving abilities.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming challenges that can be solved in any programming language. The challenges range from easy to hard and are a great way to improve coding skills and learn new concepts.

## Repository Structure
```

`-- /day25
```

Each day’s challenge is placed in its own directory, containing the Rust solution and any input files or additional resources.

## Learning Goals

* Rust Proficiency: Enhancing my knowledge and proficiency in Rust
* Algorithmic Thinking: Developing efficient algorithms to solve complex problems.
* Code Optimization: Writing clean, optimized, and well-commented code.

## How to Use

* Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/cptjpk/advent-of-code-2023.git
* Navigate to the day’s directory: `cd day01`
